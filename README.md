## Documentation

The documentation for this plugin can be found on my [wiki site](https://wiki.noah.pm/books/uqueue).

## Translations

Translated versions of messages.yml can be found in the [translations folder](https://github.com/NoahvdAa/uQueue/tree/master/translations). When creating a new translation, you should put your name right below the ASCII art, like this:

```yaml
#
# <ascii art>
# By NoahvdAa
#
# <language> Translation (In the language you're translating in)
# Translated by <your name> (In the language you're translating in)
#
```
